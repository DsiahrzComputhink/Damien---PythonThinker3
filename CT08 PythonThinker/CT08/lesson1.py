# -- Classes and Object Oriented Programming [OOP]
    # OOP is a way of organizing code that is based on real-world objects.
    # A Class will have Attribute and Behaviour
    # Class: A blueprint that defines what an object should have and what it can do.

# Instead of:
Placeholder = {
    behaviour1:"behaviour1",
    behaviour1:"behaviour1",
    behaviour1:"behaviour1",
}
class Placeholder:
    def __init__(self,behaviour1,behaviour2,behaviour3):
        self.behaviour1 = behaviour1
        self.behaviour2 = behaviour2
        self.behaviour3 = behaviour3
