-- Please do note
I would highly suggest not to alter the text files as they are meant to be archived.

The archive.py contains a few functions that are mainly for aesthetics.
Please note that the timing may not be accurate

Also, any files with [example].txt in any of the lessons is subject to change as the code will alter the files
